<h1>Project for VolHacks 2019!<\h1>

<p><h2>His name is Jeremy and he will become your new best friend, or youe new worst enemy.<h2></p>
<p><h2>Jeremy is a talking head who will remember your face and converse with you for hours....better than most people can do! (but don't ask him if he's a robot..he's self conscious about that).<\h2></p>

<p>Details: Jeremy was created using Python. His facial recognition, speech to text, and text to speech are all handled using Python libraries (dlib, speech_recognizer, espeak). His chatty capabilities are handled using Cleverbot's API.</p>

<p>Jeremy won VolHack's 2019 best presentation award.</p>
